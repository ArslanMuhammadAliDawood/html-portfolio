<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I studying a Masters in computer science at University College Dublin. I am an aspiring software engineer.I want to grow my programming skills to a very proficient level.My passion for programming sparked in September 2021 when I was working part-time at the Mater hospital where I was introduced to the python programming language by a bioinformatician. I loved the idea of combining logic with creativity and since then my goal was to break into the tech industry. I finish my Masters in December 2024 and I hope that by that time I will have gained a lot of confidence in my programming skills to tackle any problem</p>

<p>I am a crazy football fan.  My favorite football player ever is Cristano Ronaldo. Another interest I have is in boxing. I was taking boxing classes around September/October 2023 but I've had to stop because of my college workload but I want to return to the classes in the summer months. My favorite boxer is Muhammad Ali. I have a huge passion for fitness.</p>
